# Backlog — "need to adds"

A dead-simple parking lot for future iterations. Drop a one-line bullet whenever
something comes up mid-flow; don't stop to design it. No status columns, no
process — just capture it so it isn't lost. Move an item into a real task/PR when
you're ready to build it. Newest at the top of each section.

Format: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] short description (why / context)`

## Ideas / features
- [2026-07-07] Survivor / early-death modeling — a death-age event that, from that
  year on, cuts household expenses by a set % (survivor spends ~70–80%), drops the
  smaller of the two Social Security benefits, and flips filing status MFJ → Single,
  while the horizon stays at the survivor's plan-end age. Today plan-end age only
  shortens the horizon; it does NOT model a death (and misleadingly improves success).

## Per-spouse modeling (planned — keep the path easy)
- [2026-07-07] Per-spouse retirement ages as independent scenario levers. Input +
  engine already store/use each person's own retirement age; what's still single is
  the Scenarios `retireAge` lever (shifts both via `retireDelay`). Split it into two
  levers so each spouse can retire at a different age within a scenario. Do NOT add
  rules that assume one household retirement age.
- [2026-07-07] Per-spouse savings. Today savings is ONE household stream
  (`plan.savings.annual`, $30k/yr) that stops when the LAST spouse retires. Move to
  per-person contributions where each portion stops at that person's own retirement
  age. Keep the current single-stream comment in createDemoHousehold from hardening
  into an invariant.

## Tech debt / structure
- [2026-07-10] Tax engine completion — see tax execution plan (NIIT, spine lines
  17–23, adapter gaps, demo-wages benchmark). Build in `src/tax/`; wire through
  `src/planning/tax/`; do not put federal tax math in `engine.js` or UI modules.
- [2026-07-10] Asset-class bucketing — per-account allocation detail in `engine.js`
  (sim truth) with new Household/Scenarios UI in `ui/*`. After tax Phase T3 or in
  parallel once tax adapter seam is stable.

## Flexibility / "don't trap the input"
- [2026-07-07] Spending lever range is a fixed $80k–$360k window (LEVCFG `spend`).
  Low-spend households (e.g. a $48k/yr retiree) get clamped, so a "−10%" scenario
  can't be expressed. Make the spend lever range flex to the household like the
  retirement-age fix did.
- [2026-07-07] SS claim-age lever when a benefit is already claimed — likely moot
  for already-retired households (same class as the retirement-age-inert fix). Decide
  whether to make it inert too.

## Demo data (optional polish)
- [2026-07-07] Demo currently has $0 working income while pre-retirement (64/63) with
  $30k/yr savings. Consider adding realistic pre-retirement earnings for the two
  years before they retire, if we want the accumulation phase to look real.

## Done (for reference; prune when stale)
- [2026-07-10] UI modularization (Phases 0–8). `index.html` → 255 lines markup;
  `src/main.js` boot/orchestration; `src/state.js`; `ui/*` view modules (dom,
  chartLayout, goalPalette, householdFactories, household, goals, sequencing,
  cashflow, scenarios, solver). `buildLevers` and retired `#scn-levers` code
  removed. `verify.mjs` scans html + modules. 156 tests + verify pass.
- [2026-07-07] Goals Horizon dead code removed from index.html (PR #67). Goals Ledger
  (`renderGoalsPage`, `initGoalsPage`) is the live view; icon/color constants kept.
- [2026-07-07] Retirement age goes inert once the household is already retired
  (hidden from Scenarios levers, no engine effect). Shipped + tested.
- [2026-07-07] Multi-household persistence + demo/blank factories, per-household
  scoped scenarios, New/Switch/Reset-Demo controls. Shipped + tested.
